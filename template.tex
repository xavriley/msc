% Motivations
%
% Artistic output but also, music industry is large and $$$
% requirements of a musical performance
% - ensemble
% - timekeeping (layers - a year is one orbit of the sun, a day one rotation on the earths' axis)
% - colocated as opposed to geo-distributed
% clock synchronization literature
% - internal, external, pulse based - how have these been applied to music so far? Which work well?
% distributed systems and music
% - music (and clock sync) is not linear data! Consistency is not the primary issue. If a peer drifts or goes out of time,
%   it doesn't create merge problems. It can simply restart and all is well. Largely stateless
% - the challenge is mainly keeping tight synchronization bounds for as much time as possible
% - also practical challenges around the experience for those using the software
% - there are *some* consistency issues though. For example, synchronizing on current tempo and other transport messages
% Ableton Live
% - aims, tradeoffs, assumptions (reliable network)
% - works via multicast, discovery, exchanging timelines
% - fault tolerance concepts (sending on all changes)
% Can it be improved upon without violating simplicity? To provide:
% - resilience to lost messages (reliable broadcast) - does it already do this?
% - resistance to crash faults (simple consensus) - protocol assumes a shared network - not sure this makes sense
% - improvements in synchronization bounds - what are the current limits? - are they perceptible? (within 10ms)
% - other things I haven't considered yet

% Possible experiment criteria
% We can't measure things like dropped writes or stale reads so what are the
% criteria for a music system? Draw comparisons with gossip analysis -
% convergence time, stability, resilience to pertubations. Also check how clock
% sync literature handles this.
% The main thing is that the tempo stays in sync for as much time as possible

% how to test it? One option - get several devices and record into same soundcard
% has the benefit of being a realistic test, easier to get setup
% other option - use soundflower and write to a multichannel wav - maybe more reproducible
% more scientific - setup jepsen and log timestamps

% further ideas - even better internal sync (at the cost of bandwidth) - Google paper
% resettable oscillators - more naturally maps onto how humans synchronize perhaps
% options for geo-distributed time synchronization
% extensions beyond music to other time sensitive domains

% What your project *must* contain
% motivations and original aims including how this work may help in future career
% assessment inc. self evaluation. How did it go? What did you do right or
%      wrong? What have you learnt about planning and execution? Where next?

% should contain
% - abstract
% - introduction
% - background research (literature survey/review)
% - either

% sofware product - software engineering method, requirements analysis, design,
% implementation, testing - also user or installation manual

% theoretical - development of theory, inc small programs, explanation of
% algorithms, descriptions of hard theory, results, analysis

% experimental - experimental results, analysis, conclusions

% - professional issues (as appendix - c. 1000 words)
% - self assessment
% - bibliography
% - any code, including instructions on how to run
% - other - layout diagrams, sample output, program listing
