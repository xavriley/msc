# Evaluating distributed time synchronization for musical applications using Ableton Link

[Read the finished thesis here](https://github.com/xavriley/msc/blob/master/template.pdf)

This repo houses the latex files for my masters thesis. I used the [Jepsen](http://jepsen.io/) framework to look at various aspects of the [Ableton Link](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/) system for synchronizing musical timing.

The code used to produce the figues is in the following two repos:

* https://github.com/xavriley/jepsen-ableton-link
* https://github.com/xavriley/ruby_ableton_link
